Java solutions for three coding problems.

---

## Problem 1: Single Number
- Uses XOR to eliminate duplicate elements.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

---

## Problem 2: Remove K Digits
- Greedy approach using stack logic.
- Removes k digits to form smallest possible number.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

---
## How to Run
1. Compile:
    ```
    javac *.java
    ```
2. Run:
    ```
    java <ClassName>
    ```

## Problem 3: Word Pattern
- Uses two HashMaps to maintain bijection mapping.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
